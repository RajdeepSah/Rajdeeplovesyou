Simple interactive web-based love game using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
Deliver the project as a single self-contained HTML file.

🌸 Game Concept

The game opens with a minimalist design:

Soft pastel or neutral background

Clean, elegant typography

Calm, romantic tone

On page load, display centered text with a gentle fade-in animation:
“Rajdeep loves you so much”

💖 User Interaction

When the user clicks or taps anywhere on the screen:

Spawn a floating heart at the click position

The heart:

Floats upward

Slightly rotates and scales

Gradually fades out

Along with the heart, display one rotating romantic message near it.

Rotate messages randomly from the following list:

I love you ❤️
Always you
Only you
Forever 💫
Just us
You mean everything to me
You make me smile
My favorite person
You feel like home
I’m grateful for you
Forever and always 💖
My heart chose you
With you, always
You are my peace
My heart is yours
I’m here for you
You’re safe with me
No matter what
You’re never alone
I’ve got you
You + Me ❤️
Still choosing you
Again and again
Together
Us 💞


Each click should create a new heart and message, allowing multiple hearts on screen at once.

🎨 Design & Animation Requirements

Minimalist, romantic aesthetic

Subtle gradient background (off-white → blush pink)

Smooth, lightweight CSS animations

Very soft shadow or glow on hearts and text

Optional, very soft “pop” or chime sound on click (low volume, non-intrusive)

⚙️ Technical Requirements

Use CSS animations instead of heavy JavaScript

Automatically remove hearts and text after animations complete

No external libraries or frameworks

Fully responsive (mobile & desktop friendly)

📦 Deliverables

Complete, working code in one HTML file

Clean, well-commented, easy-to-understand code

Ready to run directly in a browser

The final result should feel soft, emotional, and intentional, not like a demo—simple, elegant, and romantic.
